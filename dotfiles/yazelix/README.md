# Yazelix v5
## Overview

Yazelix integrates yazi, zellij and helix, hence the name, get it?

- Zellij orchestrates everything, with yazi as a sidebar and helix as the editor
- You can open and close the sidebar by switching zellij layouts (press `alt ]` and `alt [`)
  - Or if you only got one pane open, make it fullscreen (`ctrl p + f` or `alt f`)
- Every keybinding from zellij that conflicts with helix is remapped (see them at the bottom)
- When you hit enter on a file/folder in the "sidebar" the following things happen:
  - If helix is already open, in a pane next to the sidebar, it will open that file/folder in a new buffer on that pane (magic)
  - If helix is not open, it will cd into the folder of the file (or the folder itself), and then open it in helix 
  - Note: It is highly recommended that you let the shell script execute in peace, so during these milliseconds don't move around
- This project holds my config files for zellij and yazi, almost like a plugin or something
  - But it's just some config files with a bit of shell scripting!

## Improvements of v5 over v4.1
- Now when you open a new pane besides the sidebar pane, it will stack by default, focusing on full panes, instead of splits
- Change zellij tab name automatically to the dir from the file you open from yazi
  - The two changes above allow you to focus much more on using a tab per project! So that every tab has a dir of their own.
  - This helps you to visually and mentally know what each tab is doing.
- Now if you want to open a split, you can still do so like this:
  - Type `ctrl p` then `r` for a split to the right
  - Type `ctrl p` then `d` for a split in the "down" direction
- **New rule** IMPORTANT: to open a file from yazi into an existing yazelix buffer, the hx plane has to be the topmost of the stack (or a single pane with no stack), otherwise it will open a new helix instance
  - If your helix pane is not the topmost, just press `ctrl h` and move it up with `k` 
- Important fix: Remapped keybindings were previously lost when attaching to a session or ressurrecting
- Important fix: https://github.com/luccahuguet/yazelix/issues/17 Failed to check if the command running in the current pane is helix
- fix: re-added move tab bindings. They were removed previously and now they work on tab mode
- Added a license

## Instructions to set it up

1. Make sure [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij), [helix](https://helix-editor.com), and [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html) are installed and in your path
2. Just clone this repo in your `~/.config` dir
3. Configure WezTerm:  
   a. Create or open your `~/.wezterm.lua` file  
   b. Add the following content:  

      ```lua
      -- Pull in the wezterm API
      local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
      -- This will hold the configuration.
      local config = wezterm.config_builder()
      -- This is where you actually apply your config choices
      -- For example, changing the color scheme:
      config.color_scheme = 'Abernathy'
      -- Spawn a nushell shell in login mode
      config.default_prog = { 'nu', '-c', "zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts" }
      -- Others
      config.hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab = true
      config.window_decorations = "NONE"
      -- and finally, return the configuration to wezterm
      return config
      ```

Notes:
  - For extra configuration, visit: https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/files.html
  - If you use another shell, you have to configure it to run something like `nu -c "zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts"` on startup  
    - or `zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layout` (but you still need `nu` anyways)
    - Another option, if you wish, run this command manually every time you open yazelix  
    - The recommended shell is Wezterm though. More on that in the Notes section below  
4. Optional: Using zoxide enhances the yazelix experience ten-fold, let me tell ya... and it integrates with yazi

That's it, and feel free to open issues and PRs ðŸ˜‰

## Why use this project?

- This project is relatively simple to understand, the inner workings and all. Just a bit of shell scripting magic, but mostly config files
- Easy to configure and make it yours
- I daily drive this, and will change it according to my needs, keeping it updated and improving it
- Zero conflict keybindings, very powerful sidebar (learning yazi is a process, but you can do very cool stuff)

## Troubleshooting

- If it's not working, try upgrading yazi and zellij to the latest version

## Possible Improvements

- Yazelix will only detect helix if it's adjacent to the sidebar. A minor thing.
- When you open a new tab, yazi opens as single pane taking all space
  - But it does not show the parents and preview columns, it only shows the current dir column
  - To address this I would have to reopen yazi with a different config? 

## Keybinding remaps

| New Zellij Keybinding | Previous Keybinding | Helix Action that uses that previous key | Zellij Action remapped    |
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ctrl e                | Ctrl o              | jump_backward                            | SwitchToMode "Session"      |
| Ctrl y                | Ctrl s              | save_selection                           | SwitchToMode "Scroll"       |
| Alt w                 | Alt i               | shrink_selection                         | MoveTab "Left"              |
| Alt q                 | Alt o               | expand_selection                         | MoveTab "Right"             |
| Alt m                 | Alt n               | select_next_sibling                      | NewPane                     |
| Alt 2                 | Ctrl b              | move_page_up                             | SwitchToMode "Tmux"         |

If you find a conflict, please open an issue. Keep in mind, though, that compatibility with tmux mode is not a goal of this project.


## Discoverability of keybindings
- zellij: zellij is great at this, works out of the box, you'll visually see all the keybindings in the status-bar
- helix: helix is the same honestly
- yazi: There is only one keybinding to remember: `~` This shows all keybindings and commands (press `alt f` to make the yazi pane fullscreen)
- nushell: you can run `tutor` on nushell, you can read the https://www.nushell.sh/book/, you can run `help commands | find regex` (if you want to learn about regex for example, but could be anything) 
    - well, I do use `ctrl r` a lot in nushell, it opens a interactive history search
  

## Keybindings tips 
- Zellij: Type `alt f` to make your pane fullscreen (and back)
- Zellij: Type `ctrl p` then `r` for a split to the right
- Zellij: Type `ctrl p` then `d` for a split in the "down" direction
- Yazi: Type `z` to use zoxide (fuzzy find to known paths)
- Yazi: Type `Z` to use fzf (fuzzy find to unknown paths)
- Yazi: Type `SPACE` to select files
- Yazi: Type `y` to `yank` and `Y` to `unyank` (cancels the copy)
- Yazi: Type `x` to `cut` and `X` to `uncut` (cancels the cut)
- Yazi: Type `a` to `add` a file (`filename.ext`) or a folder (`foldername/`)


## Tips
- You can add more swap layouts as needed, using the KDL files in `layouts`.
- I recommend using wezterm as your terminal
  - because it can be configured to remove its native tabs, very extensible, including its keybindings (haven't found a conflict yet)
  - very performant
- If you test this with nvim and it works, let me know (see the issue [here](https://github.com/luccahuguet/zellij/issues/2))
- Special thanks to yazi's, zellij's and helix's contributors/maintainers! 
- Yazi's author graciously contributed some lua code to make yazi's status bar look awesome in the small width of a sidebar
  - Thanks for that!
- If you accidentaly close the sidebar, you can get it back with `env YAZI_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config/yazelix/yazi/sidebar yazi`

## Im lost, it's too much information

In this case, learn how to use zellij on it's own first. And then optionally yazi. And then re-read the readme.
