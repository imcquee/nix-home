# Yazelix: Yazi Files

### Details
- Ratio is set to [0, 4, 0], so 0/4 width for parent, 4/4 width for current, 0/4 width for preview
- This ratio was chosen because in my setup yazi only has 20% of the total width
- There is now a init.lua file that makes the status bar way more readable (but you don't need lua as a dependency, so no worries)
- The init.lua file was added as a PR by the yazi creator themselves! What an honor, honestly.
