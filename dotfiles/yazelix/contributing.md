## Contributing to Yazelix

We welcome contributions to Yazelix! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

### Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch to work on an issue, please use the following naming convention:

```
issue_{number-of-issue}
```

For example, if you're working on issue #42, your branch should be named `issue_42`.

We follow a "one branch per issue" approach to keep changes focused and manageable.

### Commit Messages

For commit messages, please use the following format:

```
#{issue-number} {commit description}
```

For example, a commit addressing issue #42 might look like:

```
#42 Add rounded corners to sidebar
```

This helps in easily tracking which commits are related to specific issues.

### Workflow

1. **Choose an issue** to work on or create a new one if needed.
2. **Create a new branch** following the naming convention above.
3. **Make your changes** in your branch, adhering to the existing code style.
4. **Commit your changes** using the commit message format described above.
5. **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
6. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch of the Yazelix repository.
7. **Describe your changes** in the PR description, linking to the relevant issue(s).
